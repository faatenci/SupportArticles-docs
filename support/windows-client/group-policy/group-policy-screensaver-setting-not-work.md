# Win7/W2k8 R2 Group Policy Screensaver setting isn't working

This article helps work around an issue where the Screensaver doesn't start after a Group Policy is configured to enable it in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp;Windows 7 Service Pack 1, Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;2616727

## Symptoms

A Group Policy is configured to enable Screensaver:

User Configuration\Administrative Templates\Control Panel\Personalization\  
 Enable screen saver 

but there's no setting defining a ScreenSaverTimeout configured in:

Screen saver timeout 

The Screensaver won't start in such a configuration by default.

## Cause

The default ScreenSaver Timeout is configured in the registry at this location:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop  
Reg_SZ ScreenSaveTimeOut

Since Windows 7 / Windows Server 2008 R2, this key doesn't exist by default.

Without configuring a default timeout via Group Policy, the system doesn't have a timeout and therefore doesn't start the screensaver.

## Resolution

There are two workarounds to solve this issue

1) Configure a Default ScreenSaver Timeout using Group Policy

User Configuration\Administrative Templates\Control Panel\Personalization\

Screen saver timeout

2) Use Group Policy Preferences to configure a new default value for

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop

Reg_SZ  
ScreenSaveTimeOut

in a Group Policy applying to users.

User Configuration => Preferences => Windows Settings => Registry

New => Registry Item

Action: Create

Hive: HKEY_CURRENT_USER

Key Path: Control Panel\Desktop

Value Name: ScreenSaveTimeOut

Value Type: REG_SZ

Value Data: 600

Using Item Level Targeting (Common Tab of setting) the appliance of this setting can be restricted to systems running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.
